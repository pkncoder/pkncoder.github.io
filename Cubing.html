                <p>Hello, my name is Kia and I am a speedcuber. If you do not know what a speedcuber is think of the iconic rubik's cube and someone solving it as fast as they can. Think of someone solving that around 13 seconds consecutively. That is where I am at of 22/4/2023.</p>
                <p>How did I learn to solve? How long have I been solving? Should you pick up this "hobby"? All will be answered.</p>
                <h2>How did I learn to solve, and how long have I been solving?</h2>
                <p>2015, there was a Rubik's Cube in the house like some people have on their shelf, colecting dust, and my father wanted to to and solve it. Teaching me, and in the process teaching himself. To this day, he may not be a speedcuber, but he still does know how to solve it. Anyways, my dad brought me on a website that teaches step-by-step (I could not find this website, so I linked another one), and gives all of the algorithms with pictures. So we set of, me and my dad I mean, and about a month or so later, we could solve it. Anyone could learn to solve, and no, it does not take an entire month to learn always. Do not let that scare you.</p>
                <h2>Should you pick up this "hobby"?</h2>
                <p>Abosolutly! Cubing is a great hobby, as well as sport. Some of the more perceptive of the group here may ha noticed the quotation marks around hobby in the header. My explaination for this is simple, it can be more than a hobby to some people, so I don't want it to seem like it is just a silly toy for teenagers. Cubing can be a life for some people, me? No not yet, if at all. I just wanted to address that.</p>
