            <h2 style="text-align: center; text-indent: none; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Hello welcome to Kia's Cottage</h2>
            <p style="background-color: rgba(131, 131, 131, .6); width: 80%">Hello, my name is Kia, and I am go by they/them pronouns. I have many things that I like to do, some more than others, but lots of random crap also. I like to code, speed solve Rubik's Cubes, play DnD, create art, play band, and some more stuff. Lets list these things listed.</p>
            <p style="background-color: rgba(131, 131, 131, .6); width: 80%">Coding: my father is an esteemed programmer in multiple catagories, and I am such a dad's child. I was curios and my father would love to show me his work. Recently I have been learning more in this field, and thinking of basing it around my carer. Languages include: Python, HTML, and CSS. An example of HTML, and CSS would be this webpage.</p>
            <p style="background-color: rgba(131, 131, 131, .6); width: 80%">Speed solving: There is more about this on the cubing tab in the navigation bar, but here is the summery. I started learning with my dad around 2015, and have enjoyed the ever joy of getting better than myself ever since.</p>
            <p style="background-color: rgba(131, 131, 131, .6); width: 80%">Dungeons and Dragons(DnD): Dungeons and dragons is a TTRPG(Table Top Role Playing Game), and uses seven dice to decide what happens when the PC(Player Character) tries to do somthing. For example: a perception check to look around the room, possibly to spot a picture. For this you would roll a d20, a 20 sided dice. I have been playing DnD for around 2 years.</p>
            <p style="background-color: rgba(131, 131, 131, .6); width: 80%">Band: I have been playing trumpet since 5th grade, and I am good for my age. I love band, marching band, jazz, etc. Band is important to me, why? Mostly because alot of my freinds are in it, and it is just fun in general!</p>
